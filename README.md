# Menstrual-Tracker
This repository contains a machine learning-based Menstruation Tracker that predicts the next menstrual cycle based on user inputs and historical data. The model utilizes Linear Regression to analyze features such as cycle length, age, estimated ovulation day, length of menstruation, and fertility window.

# Features
✅ Predicts the next period date using historical menstrual data
✅ Takes user inputs such as birthdate, last period date, and personal cycle details
✅ Machine Learning model (Linear Regression) trained on menstrual cycle data
✅ Provides visualization of cycle trends
✅ Helps users track and better understand their menstrual health

# Technologies Used
Python
Pandas & NumPy (Data Processing)
Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning)
Matplotlib (Data Visualization)

# How It Works
Users input personal details (birthdate, last period date, ovulation estimates, etc.).
The model predicts the next cycle length using historical cycle data.
The predicted cycle length is used to estimate the next period date.
A graph visualization of past cycles and predictions is displayed.

# Usage
Run the script in a Python environment and enter the required details when prompted. The system will predict and display the expected next period date along with cycle insights.
